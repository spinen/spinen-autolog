# If the process has been idle (or connected) more than "idle" minutes,

# If idle<0, the process is exempt.
# If idle=0, the users must not be idle for to long :) -> debugging
# If "nowarn" is asserted, the user will
#    not be warned that it is about to be killed.
# After "grace" seconds, autolog will attempt to kill the process.
# If "mail" is asserted, mail will be sent to the user
#     telling how his process met its end.
# If "hard is asserted, the process will be killed
#     after "idle" minutes of total session time (rather than idle time).
# ban=xx: A user extending his session-limit will be banned for xx minutes.
